## Motivation

After learning the Swift programming language I found a very useful utility under darwin systems (Mac OS X) which is the [ByteCountFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bytecountformatter) there is where I based this project, also needed this for a long-run project (also used in our other package: [machine-stats](https://github.com/open-southeners/machine-stats)) therefore here it is.
